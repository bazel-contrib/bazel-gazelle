# Gazelle build file generator

Gazelle is a build file generator for Bazel projects. It can create new BUILD.bazel files for a project that follows language conventions, and it can update existing build files to include new sources, dependencies, and options. Gazelle natively supports Go and protobuf, and it may be [extended](extend.md) to support new languages and custom rule sets.

Gazelle may be run by Bazel using the [`gazelle` rule](#bazel-rule) or it may be installed and run as a command line tool. Gazelle can also generate build files for external repositories as part of the [`go_repository`](reference.md#go_repository) rule.

*Gazelle is under active development. Its interface and the rules it generates may change. Gazelle is not an official Google product.*

## Supported languages

Gazelle can generate Bazel BUILD files for many languages:

* **Go:** Go supported is included here in bazel-gazelle, see below.
* **Haskell:**  Tweag's [rules_haskell](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell) has two extensions: [gazelle_cabal](https://github.com/tweag/gazelle_cabal), for generating rules from Cabal files, and [gazelle_haskell_modules](https://github.com/tweag/gazelle_haskell_modules) for even more fine-grained build definitions.
* **Java:** bazel-contrib's [rules_jvm](https://github.com/bazel-contrib/rules_jvm) extensions include [a gazelle extension](https://github.com/bazel-contrib/rules_jvm/tree/main/java/gazelle) for generating `java_library`, `java_binary`, `java_test`, and `java_test_suite` rules.
* **JavaScript / TypeScript:** Aspect provides [JavaScript and TypeScript Support](https://github.com/aspect-build/aspect-cli/blob/main/gazelle/js/) in aspect-cli (also usable separately). BenchSci's [rules_nodejs_gazelle](https://github.com/benchsci/rules_nodejs_gazelle) supports generating `ts_project`, `js_library`, `jest_test`, and `web_asset` rules, and is able to support module bundlers like Webpack and Next.js.
* **Kotlin:** Aspect Build provides some [Kotlin Support](https://github.com/aspect-build/aspect-cli/blob/main/gazelle/kotlin/) in the repo of their aspect-cli (also usable separately). Still under development, please check the README for currently available features.
* **Protocol Buffers:** Support for the `proto_library` rule, as well as `go_proto_library` is in this repository, see below. Other language-specific proto rules are not supported here. [stackb/rules_proto](https://github.com/stackb/rules_proto) is a good resource for these rules.
* **Python:** [rules_python](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python) has an extension for generating `py_library`, `py_binary`, and `py_test` rules.
* **R:** [rules_r](https://github.com/grailbio/rules_r) has an extension for generating rules for R package builds and tests.
* **Rust:** [gazelle_rust](https://github.com/Calsign/gazelle_rust) is an extension for generating [rules_rust](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_rust) targets.
* **Starlark:** [bazel-skylib](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib) has an extension for generating `bzl_library` rules. See [bazel_skylib/gazelle/bzl](bazel_skylib/gazelle/bzl).
* **Swift:** [swift_gazelle_plugin](https://github.com/cgrindel/swift_gazelle_plugin) has an extension for generating `swift_library`, `swift_binary`, and   `swift_test` rules. It also includes facilities for resolving, downloading and building external Swift packages for a Bazel workspace.
* **C/C++:** [gazelle_cc](https://github.com/EngFlow/gazelle_cc) has an extension for `cc_*` rules.

If you know of an extension which could be linked here, please [open a PR](https://github.com/bazel-contrib/bazel-gazelle/edit/master/README.rst)!

More languages can be added by [Extending Gazelle](extend.md). Chat with us in the `#gazelle` channel on [Bazel Slack](https://slack.bazel.build) if you'd like to discuss your design.

If you've written your own extension, please consider open-sourcing it for use by the rest of the community. Note that such extensions belong in a language-specific repository, not in bazel-gazelle. See discussion in [#1030](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/issues/1030).

## Setup

### Bzlmod

See the [Go Bzlmod docs](https://github.com/bazel-contrib/rules_go/blob/master/docs/go/core/bzlmod.md).

The full documentation for the `go_deps` extension is in [extensions.md](extensions.md#go_deps).

### WORKSPACE

To use Gazelle in a new project, add the `bazel_gazelle` repository and its dependencies to your WORKSPACE file and call `gazelle_dependencies`. It should look like this:

```bzl
load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl", "http_archive")

http_archive(
    name = "io_bazel_rules_go",
    integrity = "sha256-M6zErg9wUC20uJPJ/B3Xqb+ZjCPn/yxFF3QdQEmpdvg=",
    urls = [
        "https://mirror.bazel.build/github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/releases/download/v0.48.0/rules_go-v0.48.0.zip",
        "https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/releases/download/v0.48.0/rules_go-v0.48.0.zip",
    ],
)

http_archive(
    name = "bazel_gazelle",
    integrity = "sha256-12v3pg/YsFBEQJDfooN6Tq+YKeEWVhjuNdzspcvfWNU=",
    urls = [
        "https://mirror.bazel.build/github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/releases/download/v0.37.0/bazel-gazelle-v0.37.0.tar.gz",
        "https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/releases/download/v0.37.0/bazel-gazelle-v0.37.0.tar.gz",
    ],
)


load("@io_bazel_rules_go//go:deps.bzl", "go_register_toolchains", "go_rules_dependencies")
load("@bazel_gazelle//:deps.bzl", "gazelle_dependencies", "go_repository")

############################################################
# Define your own dependencies here using go_repository.
# Else, dependencies declared by rules_go/gazelle will be used.
# The first declaration of an external repository "wins".
############################################################

go_rules_dependencies()

go_register_toolchains(version = "1.20.5")

gazelle_dependencies()
```

`gazelle_dependencies` supports optional argument `go_env` (dict-mapping)
to set project specific go environment variables. If you are using a
`WORKSPACE.bazel` file, you will need to specify that using:

```bzl
gazelle_dependencies(go_repository_default_config = "//:WORKSPACE.bazel")
```

Add the code below to the BUILD or BUILD.bazel file in the root directory
of your repository.

**Important:** For Go projects, replace the string after `prefix` with
the portion of your import path that corresponds to your repository.

```bzl
load("@bazel_gazelle//:def.bzl", "gazelle")

# gazelle:prefix github.com/example/project
gazelle(name = "gazelle")
```

After adding this code, you can run Gazelle with Bazel.

```
bazel run //:gazelle
```

This will generate new BUILD.bazel files for your project. You can run the same command in the future to update existing BUILD.bazel files to include new source files or options.

You can write other `gazelle` rules to run alternate commands like `update-repos`.

```bzl
gazelle(
    name = "gazelle-update-repos",
    args = [
        "-from_file=go.mod",
        "-to_macro=deps.bzl%go_dependencies",
        "-prune",
    ],
    command = "update-repos",
)
```

You can also pass additional arguments to Gazelle after a `--` argument.

```
bazel run //:gazelle -- update-repos -from_file=go.mod -to_macro=deps.bzl%go_dependencies
```

After running `update-repos`, you might want to run `bazel run //:gazelle` again, as the `update-repos` command can affect the output of a normal run of Gazelle.

To verify that all BUILD files are update-to-date, you can use the `gazelle_test` rule.

```
load("@bazel_gazelle//:def.bzl", "gazelle_test")

gazelle_test(
    name = "gazelle_test",
    workspace = "//:BUILD.bazel", # a file in the workspace root, where the gazelle will be run
)
```

However, please note that gazelle_test cannot be cached.

### Running Gazelle with Go

If you have a Go toolchain installed, you can install Gazelle with the command below:

```
go install github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/cmd/gazelle@latest
```

Make sure to re-run this command to upgrade Gazelle whenever you upgrade rules_go in your repository.

To generate BUILD.bazel files in a new project, run the command below, replacing the prefix with the portion of your import path that corresponds to your repository.

```
gazelle -go_prefix github.com/example/project
```

Most of Gazelle's command-line arguments can be expressed as special comments in build files. See Directives_ below. You may want to copy this line into your root build  files to avoid having to type `-go_prefix` every time.

```bzl
# gazelle:prefix github.com/example/project
```

## Compatibility with Go

Gazelle is compatible with supported releases of Go, per the [Go Release Policy](https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html#policy). The Go Team officially supports the current and previous minor releases. Older releases are not supported and don't receive bug fixes or security updates.

Gazelle may use language and library features from the oldest supported release.

## Compatibility with rules_go

Gazelle generates build files that use features in newer versions of `rules_go`. Newer versions of Gazelle *may* generate build files that work with older versions of `rules_go`, but check the table below to ensure you're using a compatible version.

## Usage

### Command line

```
gazelle <command> [flags...] [package-dirs...]
```

The first argument to Gazelle may be one of the commands below. If no command is specified, `update` is assumed. The remaining arguments are specific to each command and are documented below.

- **[update](#fix-and-update):** Scans sources files, then generates and updates build files.
- **[fix](#fix-and-update):** Same as the `update` command, but it also fixes deprecated usage of rules.
- **[update-repos](#update-repos):** Adds and updates repository rules in the WORKSPACE file.

### Bazel rule

Gazelle may be run via a rule. See the [Setup instructions](#setup). This rule builds Gazelle and generates a wrapper script that executes Gazelle with baked-in set of arguments. You can run this script with `bazel run`, or you can copy it into your workspace and run it directly.

The following attributes are available on the `gazelle` rule.

**Name:** `gazelle`<br>
**Type:** *label*<br>
**Default:** `@bazel_gazelle//cmd/gazelle`<br>
The [`gazelle_binary`](reference.md#gazelle_binary) rule that builds Gazelle. You can substitute a modified version of Gazelle with this. See [Extending Gazelle](extend.md).

**Name:** `external`<br>
**Type:** *string*<br>
**Default:** `external`<br>
The method for resolving unknown imports to Bazel dependencies. May be :value:`external`, :value:`static` or :value:`vendored`. See [Dependency resolution](#dependency-resolution).

**Name:** `build_tags`<br>
**Type:** *string_list*<br>
**Default:** `[]`<br>
The list of Go build tags that Gazelle should consider to always be true.

**Name:** `prefix`<br>
**Type:** *string*<br>
**Default:** `""`<br>
The import path that corresponds to the repository root directory. Note: It's usually better to write a directive like
`# gazelle:prefix example.com/repo` in your build file instead of setting
this attribute.

**Name:** `extra_args`<br>
**Type:** *string_list**<br>
**Default:** `[]`<br>
A list of extra command line arguments passed to Gazelle. Note that `extra_args` are suppressed by extra command line args (e.g. `bazel run //:gazelle -- subdir`). See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/issues/536 for explanation.

**Name:** `command`<br>
**Type:** *string*<br>
**Default:** `update`
The Gazelle command to use. May be :value:`fix`, :value:`update` or :value:`update-repos`.

### `fix` and `update`

The `update` command is the most common way of running Gazelle. Gazelle scans sources in directories throughout the repository, then creates and updates build files.

The `fix` command does everything `update` does, but it also fixes deprecated usage of rules, analogous to `go fix`. For example, `cgo_library` will be consolidated with `go_library`. This command may delete or rename rules, so it's not on by default. See [Fix command transformations](#fix-command-transformations) for details.

Both commands accept a list of directories to process as positional arguments. If no directories are specified, Gazelle will process the current directory. Subdirectories will be processed recursively by default (unless `-r=false`).

The following flags are accepted:

**Flag:** `-build_file_name=file1,file2,...`<br>
**Default:** `BUILD.bazel,BUILD`<br>
Comma-separated list of file names. Gazelle recognizes these files as Bazel build files. New files will use the first name in this list. Use this if your project contains non-Bazel files named `BUILD` (or `build` on case-insensitive file systems).

**Flag:** `-build_tags=tag1,tag2,...`<br>
**Default:** n/a<br>
List of Go build tags Gazelle will defer to Bazel for evaluation. Gazelle applies constraints when generating Go rules. It assumes certain tags are true on certain platforms (for example, `amd64,linux`). It assumes all Go release tags are true (for example, `go1.8`). It considers other tags to be false (for example, `ignore`). This flag allows custom tags to be evaluated by Bazel at build time. Bazel may still filter sources with these tags. Use `bazel build --define gotags=foo,bar` to set tags at build time.

**Flag:** `-exclude=pattern`<br>
**Default:** n/a<br>
Prevents Gazelle from processing a file or directory if the given [`doublestar.Match`](https://github.com/bmatcuk/doublestar#match) pattern matches. If the pattern refers to a source file, Gazelle won't include it in any rules. If the pattern refers to a directory, Gazelle won't recurse into it. This option may be repeated. Patterns must be slash-separated, relative to the repository root. This is equivalent to the `# gazelle:exclude pattern` directive.

**Flag:** `-external=external|static|vendored`<br>
**Default:** `external`<br>
Determines how Gazelle resolves Go import paths that cannot be resolved in the current repository. May be :value:`external`, :value:`static` or :value:`vendored`. See [Dependency resolution](#dependency-resolution).

**Flag:** `-index=none|lazy|all`<br>
**Default:** `all`<br>
Determines whether Gazelle should index the libraries in the current repository and whether it should use the index to resolve dependencies.

If `none` or `false`, indexing is disabled, and Gazelle relies purely on conventions to translate language-specific import strings into dependency labels.

If `lazy`, Gazelle indexes libraries in directories it visits explicitly. Language extensions may be configured to index additional directories through directives like `# gazelle:go_search`. This mode is very fast when recursion is disabled with `-r=false`.

If `all` or `true`, Gazelle indexes all directories in the repository, even when recursion is disabled. This makes dependency resolution simple but can be slow for large repositories.

**Flag:** `-go_grpc_compiler=label`<br>
**Default:** `@io_bazel_rules_go//proto:go_grpc_v2`<br>
The protocol buffers compiler to use for building go bindings for gRPC. May be repeated. See [Predefined plugins](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/blob/master/proto/core.rst#predefined-plugins) for available options; commonly used options include `@io_bazel_rules_go//proto:gofast_grpc` and `@io_bazel_rules_go//proto:gogofaster_grpc`.

**Flag:** `-go_naming_convention`<br>
**Default:** inferred<br>
Controls the names of generated Go targets. Equivalent to the `# gazelle:go_naming_convention` directive. See details in [Directives](#directives) below.

**Flag:** `-go_naming_convention_external`<br>
**Default:** `import`<br>
Controls the default naming convention used when resolving libraries in external repositories with unknown naming conventions. Equivalent to the `# gazelle:go_naming_convention_external` directive.

**Flag:** `-go_prefix=example.com/repo`<br>
**Default:** n/a<br>
A prefix of import paths for Go libraries in the repository that corresponds to the repository root. Equivalent to setting the `# gazelle:prefix` directive in the root BUILD.bazel file or the `prefix` attribute of the `gazelle` rule. If neither of those are set, this option is mandatory. This prefix is used to determine whether an import path refers to a library in the current repository or an external dependency.

**Flag:** `-go_proto_compiler=label`<br>
**Default:** `@io_bazel_rules_go//proto:go_proto`<br>
The protocol buffers compiler to use for building go bindings. May be repeated. See [Predefined plugins](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/blob/master/proto/core.rst#predefined-plugins) for available options; commonly used options include `@io_bazel_rules_go//proto:gofast_proto` and `@io_bazel_rules_go//proto:gogofaster_proto`.

**Flag:** `-known_import=example.com`<br>
**Default:** n/a<br>
Skips Go import path resolution for a known domain. May be repeated.

When Gazelle resolves an import path to an external dependency, it attempts to discover the remote repository root over HTTP. Gazelle skips this discovery step for a few well-known domains with predictable structure, like golang.org and github.com. This flag specifies additional domains to skip, which is useful in situations where the lookup would fail for some reason.

**Flag:** `-mode=fix|print|diff`<br>
**Default:** `fix`<br>
Method for emitting merged build files. In `fix` mode, Gazelle writes generated and merged files to disk. In `print` mode, it prints them to stdout. In `diff` mode, it prints a unified diff.

**Flag:** `-proto=default|file|package|legacy|disable|disable_global`<br>
**Default:** `default`<br>
Determines how Gazelle should generate rules for .proto files. See details in [Directives](#directives) below.

**Flag:** `-proto_group=group`<br>
**Default:** n/a<br>
Determines the proto option Gazelle uses to group .proto files into rules when in `package` mode. See details in [Directives](#directives) below.

**Flag:** `-proto_import_prefix=path`<br>
**Default:** n/a<br>
Sets the [`import_prefix`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/protocol-buffer.html#proto_library.import_prefix) attribute of generated `proto_library` rules. This adds a prefix to the string used to import `.proto` files listed in the `srcs` attribute of generated rules. Equivalent to the `# gazelle:proto_import_prefix` directive. See details in [Directives](#directives) below.

**Flag:** `-r`<br>
**Default:** `true`<br>
Controls whether Gazelle recurses into subdirectories of the directories named on the command line. This is enabled by default, so when Gazelle is run from the repository root directory without arguments, it visits and updates all directories. This can be slow for large repositories.

When recursion is disabled, Gazelle only visits specific named directories. This can be very fast, but you may also want to use lazy indexing (`-index=lazy`) or disable indexing altogether (`-index=none`).

**Flag:** `-repo_root=dir`<br>
**Default:** inferred<br>
The root directory of the repository. Gazelle normally infers this to be the directory containing the WORKSPACE file. Gazelle will not process packages outside this directory.

**Flag:** `-lang=lang1,lang2`<br>
**Default:** n/a<br>
Selects languages for which to compose and index rules. By default, all languages that this Gazelle was built with are processed.

**Flag:** `-cpuprofile=filename`<br>
**Default:** n/a<br>
If specified, gazelle uses [runtime/pprof](https://pkg.go.dev/runtime/pprof#StartCPUProfile) to collect CPU profiling information from the command and save it to the given file. By default, this is disabled.

**Flag:** `-memprofile=filename`<br>
**Default:** n/a<br>
If specified, gazelle uses [runtime/pprof](https://pkg.go.dev/runtime/pprof#WriteHeapProfile) to collect memory a profile information from the command and save it to a file. By default, this is disabled.

### Lazy indexing in `fix` and `update`

By default, `fix` and `update` read all build files in a repo to build an index of library rules (see [Dependency resolution](#dependency-resolution)) when Gazelle starts. This can take a long time on a large repo. To avoid this problem, Gazelle can lazily index specific directories, with help from extensions that support lazy indexing.

To configure lazy indexing with Go, add `go_search` directives like this:

```bzl
# gazelle:go_search third_party/go
# gazelle:go_search replace/b example.com/b
```

These directives point to directories that contain Go code outside the current module, with an optional package prefix. `go_search` directives are not necessary if you're following regular Go module conventions or are using a Go `vendor` directory.

To configure lazy indexing with protobuf, add `proto_search` directives like this:

```bzl
# gazelle:proto_search third_party/proto api
```

The two arguments are a prefix to remove from the import path and a prefix to add. These correspond to the [`strip_import_prefix`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/protocol-buffer.html#proto_library.strip_import_prefix) and [`import_prefix`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/protocol-buffer.html#proto_library.import_prefix) attributes of [`proto_library`](https://bazel.build/reference/be/protocol-buffer#proto_library). They tell Gazelle how to transform an import path read from a .proto source file into a repo-root-relative path to a directory that may contain the imported file.

To use Gazelle with lazy indexing, run with `-r=false -index=lazy`, and pass the directories to update on the command line.

```bzl
gazelle -r=false -index=lazy path/to/dir1 path/to/dir2
```

You can configure your `gazelle` Bazel target to pass these flags automatically:

```bzl
load("@gazelle//:def.bzl", "gazelle", "gazelle_binary")

gazelle(
    name = "gazelle",
    command = "fix",
    extra_args = ["-r=false", "-index=lazy"],
    gazelle = ":gazelle_binary",
)

gazelle_binary(
    name = "gazelle_binary",
    ...
)
```

### `update-repos`

The `update-repos` command updates repository rules.  It can write the rules to either the WORKSPACE (by default) or a .bzl file macro function.  It can be used to add new repository rules or update existing rules to the specified version. It can also import repository rules from a `go.mod` or a `go.work` file.

WARNING: This command is mainly used for managing external Go dependencies in Bazel's WORKSPACE mode. For managing external Go dependencies in Bazel's BzlMod mode, please check: https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/blob/master/docs/go/core/bzlmod.md#external-dependencies

```bash
# Add or update a repository to latest version by import path
$ gazelle update-repos example.com/new/repo

# Add or update a repository to specified version/commit by import path
$ gazelle update-repos example.com/new/repo@v1.3.1

# Import repositories from go.mod
$ gazelle update-repos -from_file=go.mod

# Import repositories from go.work
$ gazelle update-repos -from_file=go.work

# Import repositories from go.mod and update macro
$ gazelle update-repos -from_file=go.mod -to_macro=repositories.bzl%go_repositories

# Import repositories from go.work and update macro
$ gazelle update-repos -from_file=go.work -to_macro=repositories.bzl%go_repositories
```

The following flags are accepted:

**Flag:** `-from_file=lock-file`<br>
**Default:** n/a<br>
Import repositories from a file as [`go_repository`](reference.md#go_repository) rules. These rules will be added to the bottom of the WORKSPACE file or merged with existing rules. The lock file format is inferred from the file name. `go.mod` and `go.work` are all supported.

**Flag:** `-repo_root=dir`<br>
**Default:** inferred<br>
The root directory of the repository. Gazelle normally infers this to be the directory containing the WORKSPACE file. Gazelle will not process packages outside this directory.

**Flag:** `-to_macro=macroFile%defName`<br>
**Default:** n/a<br>
Tells Gazelle to write new repository rules into a .bzl macro function rather than the WORKSPACE file. The `repository_macro` directive should be added to the WORKSPACE in order for future Gazelle calls to recognize the repos defined in the macro file.

**Flag:** `-prune`<br>
**Default:** `false`<br>
When true, Gazelle will remove [`go_repository`](reference.md#go_repository) rules that no longer have equivalent repos in the `go.mod` file. This flag can only be used with `-from_file`.                                                                                                         |

**Flag:** `-build_directives=arg1,arg2,...`<br>
**Default:** n/a<br>
Sets the `build_directives attribute` for the generated [`go_repository`](reference.md#go_repository) rule(s).

**Flag:** `-build_external=external|vendored`<br>
**Default:** n/a<br>
Sets the `build_external` attribute for the generated [`go_repository`](reference.md#go_repository) rule(s).

**Flag:** `-build_extra_args=arg1,arg2,...`<br>
**Default:** n/a<br>
Sets the `build_extra_args attribute` for the generated [`go_repository`](reference.md#go_repository) rule(s).

**Flag:** `-build_file_generation=auto|on|off|clean`<br>
**Default:** n/a<br>
Sets the `build_file_generation` attribute for the generated [`go_repository`](reference.md#go_repository) rule(s).

**Flag:** `-build_file_names=file1,file2,...`<br>
**Default:** n/a<br>
Sets the `build_file_name` attribute for the generated [`go_repository`](reference.md#go_repository) rule(s).

**Flag:** `-build_file_proto_mode=default|package|legacy|disable|disable_global`<br>
**Default:** n/a<br>
Sets the `build_file_proto_mode` attribute for the generated [`go_repository`](reference.md#go_repository) rule(s).

**Flag:** `-build_tags=tag1,tag2,...`<br>
**Default:** n/a<br>
Sets the `build_tags` attribute for the generated [`go_repository`](reference.md#go_repository) rule(s).

### Directives

Gazelle can be configured with *directives*, which are written as top-level comments in build files. Most options that can be set on the command line can also be set using directives. Some options can only be set with directives.

Directive comments have the form `# gazelle:key value`. For example:

```bzl
load("@io_bazel_rules_go//go:def.bzl", "go_library")

# gazelle:prefix github.com/example/project
# gazelle:build_file_name BUILD,BUILD.bazel

go_library(
    name = "go_default_library",
    srcs = ["example.go"],
    importpath = "github.com/example/project",
    visibility = ["//visibility:public"],
)
```

Directives apply in the directory where they are set *and* in subdirectories. This means, for example, if you set `# gazelle:prefix` in the build file in your project's root directory, it affects your whole project. If you set it in a subdirectory, it only affects rules in that subtree.

The following directives are recognized:

**Directive:** `# gazelle:alias_kind macro_name wrapped_kind`<br>
**Default:** n/a<br>
Denotes that a macro aliases / wraps a given rule.

If you have a wrapper macro around a rule that gazelle knows how to update the attrs for, the alias_kind directive will instruct gazelle that it should treat the particular marco like the underlying wrapped kind.

`alias_kind` is different from the `map_kind` directive in that it does not force the rule to be generated as the wrapped kind. Instead, it just instructs gazelle that it should index and update the attrs for rules that match the macro.

For example, if you use `# gazelle:alias_kind my_foo_binary foo_binary`, Gazelle will still generate `foo_binary` targets when generating new targets from new source files. It is up to a person to update the `foo_binary` targets to `my_foo_binary` targets. Once this manual step is done, Gazelle will continue to update the `my_foo_binary` targets as if they were `foo_binary` targets.

Wrapper macros are commonly used to handle common boilerplate or to add deploy/release verbs, as described in the bazel [Verbs Tutorial](https://bazel.build/rules/verbs-tutorial).

**Directive:** `# gazelle:build_file_names name1,name2...`<br>
**Default:** `BUILD.bazel,BUILD`<br>
Comma-separated list of file names. Gazelle recognizes these files as Bazel build files. New files will use the first name in this list. Use this if your project contains non-Bazel files named `BUILD` (or `build` on case-insensitive file systems).

**Directive:** `# gazelle:build_tags foo,bar`<br>
**Default:** n/a<br>
List of Go build tags Gazelle will defer to Bazel for evaluation. Gazelle applies constraints when generating Go rules. It assumes certain tags are true on certain platforms (for example, `amd64,linux`). It assumes all Go release tags are true (for example, `go1.8`). It considers other tags to be false (for example, `ignore`). This flag allows custom tags to be evaluated by Bazel at build time. Bazel may still filter sources with these tags. Use `bazel build --define gotags=foo,bar` to set tags at build time.

**Directive:** `# gazelle:exclude pattern`<br>
**Default:** n/a<br>
Prevents Gazelle from processing a file or directory if the given [`doublestar.Match`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/bmatcuk/doublestar/v4#Match) pattern matches. If the pattern refers to a source file, Gazelle won't include it in any rules. If the pattern refers to a directory, Gazelle won't recurse into it. This directive may be repeated to exclude multiple patterns, one per line.

**Directive:** `# gazelle:follow pattern`<br>
**Default:** n/a<br>
Instructs Gazelle to follow a symbolic link to a directory within the repository if the given [`doublestar.Match`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/bmatcuk/doublestar/v4#Match) pattern matches. Normally, Gazelle does not follow symbolic links unless they point outside of the repository root. Care must be taken to avoid visiting a directory more than once. The `# gazelle:exclude` directive may be used to prevent Gazelle from recursing into a directory.

**Directive:** `# gazelle:generation_mode create_and_update|update_only`<br>
**Default:** `create_and_update`<br>
Declares if gazelle should create and update `BUILD` files per directory or only update existing `BUILD` files. Valid values are: `create_and_update` and `update_only`.

**Directive:** `# gazelle:go_generate_proto true|false`<br>
**Default:** `true`<br>
Instructs Gazelle's Go extension whether to generate `go_proto_library` rules for `proto_library` rules generated by the Proto extension. When this directive is `true` Gazelle will generate `go_proto_library` and `go_library` according to `# gazelle:proto`. When this directive is `false`, the Go extension will ignore any `proto_library` rules. If there are any pre-generated Go files, they will be treated as regular Go files.

**Directive:** `# gazelle:go_search dir prefix`<br>
**Default:** n/a<br>
When lazy indexing is enabled (`-index=lazy`), this directive tells Gazelle about additional directories containing Go libraries that should be indexed for dependency resolution. Specific directories are indexed as needed based on Go import directives seen.

The `dir` argument is a slash-separated path relative to the directory containing the build file. The `prefix` argument is optional. It indicates a Go prefix for the named directory, which is useful for nested modules or module replacement directories.

`go_search` may be used multiple times. Each setting adds to the search path for the current directory and subdirectories. If `go_search` is used without arguments, it clears the current list of search paths.

As an example, suppose you have a vendor directory with a non-standard name, `third_party/go`, and a module replacement directory `replace/b`. You can index these directories with:

```bzl
# gazelle:go_search third_party/go
# gazelle:go_search replace/b example.com/b
```

**Directive:** `# gazelle:go_test default|file`<br>
**Default:** `default`<br>
Tells Gazelle how to generate rules for _test.go files. Valid values are:

* `default`: One `go_test` rule will be generated whose `srcs` includes all `_test.go` files in the directory.
* `file`: A distinct `go_test` rule will be generated for each `_test.go` file in the package directory.

**Directive:** `# gazelle:go_grpc_compilers compiler1,compiler2,...`<br>
**Default:** `@io_bazel_rules_go//proto:go_grpc_v2`<br>
The protocol buffers compiler(s) to use for building go bindings for gRPC. Multiple compilers, separated by commas, may be specified. Omit the directive value to reset `go_grpc_compilers` back to the default. See [Predefined plugins](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/blob/master/proto/core.rst#predefined-plugins) for available options; commonly used options include `@io_bazel_rules_go//proto:gofast_grpc` and `@io_bazel_rules_go//proto:gogofaster_grpc`.

**Directive:** `# gazelle:go_naming_convention mode`<br>
**Default:** inferred
Controls the names of generated Go targets. Valid values are:

* `go_default_library`: Library targets are named `go_default_library`, test targets are named `go_default_test`.
* `import`: Library and test targets are named after the last segment of their import path. For example, `example.repo/foo` is named `foo`, and the test target is `foo_test`. Major version suffixes like `/v2` are dropped. For a main package with a binary `foobin`, the names are instead `foobin_lib` and `foobin_test`.
* `import_alias`: Same as `import`, but an `alias` target is generated named `go_default_library` to ensure backwards compatibility.

If no naming convention is set, Gazelle attempts to infer the convention in use by reading the root build file and build files in immediate subdirectories. If no Go targets are found, Gazelle defaults to `import`.

**Directive:** `# gazelle:go_naming_convention_external`<br>
**Default:** `import`<br>
Controls the default naming convention used when resolving libraries in external repositories with unknown naming conventions. Accepts the same values as `go_naming_convention`.

**Directive:** `# gazelle:go_proto_compilers`<br>
**Default:** `@io_bazel_rules_go//proto:go_proto`<br>
The protocol buffers compiler(s) to use for building go bindings. Multiple compilers, separated by commas, may be specified. Omit the directive value to reset `go_proto_compilers` back to the default. See [Predefined plugins](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/blob/master/proto/core.rst#predefined-plugins) for available options; commonly used options include `@io_bazel_rules_go//proto:gofast_proto` and `@io_bazel_rules_go//proto:gogofaster_proto`.

**Directive:** `# gazelle:ignore`<br>
**Default:** n/a<br>
Prevents Gazelle from modifying the build file. Gazelle will still read rules in the build file and may modify build files in subdirectories.

**Directive:** `# gazelle:importpath_prefix`<br>
**Default:** see below<br>
A prefix for `importmap` attributes in Go library rules. Gazelle will set an `importmap` on a `go_library` or `go_proto_library` by concatenating this with the relative path from the directory where the prefix is set to the library. For example, if `importmap_prefix` is set to `"x/example.com/repo"` in the build file `//foo/bar:BUILD.bazel`, then a library in `foo/bar/baz` will have the `importmap` of `"x/example.com/repo/baz"`.

`importmap` is not set when it matches `importpath`.

As a special case, when Gazelle enters a directory named `vendor`, it sets `importmap_prefix` to a string based on the repository name and the location of the vendor directory. If you wish to override this, you'll need to set `importmap_prefix` explicitly in the vendor directory.

**Directive:** `# gazelle:map_kind from_kind to_kind to_kind_load`<br>
**Default:** n/a<br>
Customizes the kind of rules generated by Gazelle.

As a separate step after generating rules, any new rules of kind `from_kind` have their kind replaced with `to_kind`. This means that `to_kind` must accept the same parameters and behave similarly.

Most commonly, this would be used to replace the rules provided by `rules_go` with custom macros. For example, `gazelle:map_kind go_binary go_deployable //tools/go:def.bzl` would configure Gazelle to produce rules of kind `go_deployable` as loaded from `//tools/go:def.bzl` instead of `go_binary`, for this directory or within.

Existing rules of the old kind will be ignored. To switch your codebase from a builtin kind to a mapped kind, use [buildozer](https://github.com/bazelbuild/buildtools/tree/master/buildozer).

**Directive:** `# gazelle:prefix path`<br>
**Default:** n/a<br>
A prefix for `importpath` attributes on library rules. Gazelle will set an `importpath` on a `go_library` or `go_proto_library` by concatenating this with the relative path from the directory where the prefix is set to the library. Most commonly, `prefix` is set to the name of a repository in the root directory of a repository. For example, in this repository, `prefix` is set in `//:BUILD.bazel` to `github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle`. The `go_library` in `//cmd/gazelle` is assigned the `importpath` `"github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/cmd/gazelle"`.

As a special case, when Gazelle enters a directory named `vendor`, it sets `prefix` to the empty string. This automatically gives vendored libraries an intuitive `importpath`.

**Directive:** `# gazelle:proto default|file|package|legacy|disable|disable_global`<br>
**Default:** `default`<br>
Tells Gazelle how to generate rules for .proto files. Valid values are:

* `default`: `proto_library`, `go_proto_library`, and `go_library` rules are generated using `@io_bazel_rules_go//proto:def.bzl`. Only one of each rule may be generated per directory. This is the default mode.
* `file`: a `proto_library` rule is generated for every .proto file.
* `package`: multiple `proto_library` and `go_proto_library` rules may be generated in the same directory. .proto files are grouped into rules based on their package name or another option (see `proto_group`).
* `legacy`: `filegroup` rules are generated for use by `@io_bazel_rules_go//proto:go_proto_library.bzl`. `go_proto_library` rules must be written by hand. Gazelle will run in this mode automatically if `go_proto_library.bzl` is loaded to avoid disrupting existing projects, but this can be overridden with a directive.
* `disable`: .proto files are ignored. Gazelle will run in this mode automatically if `go_proto_library` is loaded from any other source, but this can be overridden with a directive.
* `disable_global`: like `disable` mode, but also prevents Gazelle from using any special cases in dependency resolution for Well Known Types and Google APIs. Useful for avoiding build-time dependencies on protoc.

This directive applies to the current directory and subdirectories. As a special case, when Gazelle enters a directory named `vendor`, if the proto mode isn't set explicitly in a parent directory or on the command line, Gazelle will run in `disable` mode. Additionally, if the file `@io_bazel_rules_go//proto:go_proto_library.bzl` is loaded, Gazelle will run in `legacy` mode.

**Directive:** `# gazelle:proto_group option`<br>
**Default:** n/a<br>
*This directive is only effective in* `package` *mode (see above).*

Specifies an option that Gazelle can use to group .proto files into rules. For example, when set to `go_package`, .proto files with the same `option go_package` will be grouped together.

When this directive is set to the empty string, Gazelle will group packages by their proto package statement.

Rule names are generated based on the last run of identifier characters in the package name. For example, if the package is `"foo/bar/baz"`, the `proto_library` rule will be named `baz_proto`.

**Directive:** `# gazelle:proto_import_prefix path`<br>
**Default:** n/a<br>
Sets the [`import_prefix`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/protocol-buffer.html#proto_library.import_prefix) attribute of generated `proto_library` rules. This adds a prefix to the string used to import `.proto` files listed in the `srcs` attribute of generated rules.

For example, if the target `//a:b_proto` has `srcs = ["b.proto"]` and `import_prefix = "github.com/x/y"`, then `b.proto` should be imported with the string `"github.com/x/y/a/b.proto"`.

**Directive:** `# gazelle:proto_search strip prefix`<br>
**Default:** n/a<br>
When lazy indexing is enabled (`-index=lazy`), this directive tells Gazelle how to transform a proto import string into a repo-root-relative directory path where the proto might be found.

Like `go_search`, this directive configures lazy indexing. However, the arguments are more similar to [`cc_search`](https://github.com/EngFlow/gazelle_cc?tab=readme-ov-file#-gazellecc_search-strip_include_prefix-include_prefix) because protobuf rules handle import strings similarly to how C++ handles include strings.

As an example, suppose you have a library in `third_party/foo/` with the label `//third_party/foo`. It has a proto file `third_party/foo/proto/api.proto` that you include as `foo/api.proto`. The library's `proto_library` target might be written as:

```bzl
proto_library(
    name = "foo",
    srcs = ["api.proto"],
    strip_import_prefix = "third_party/foo/proto",
    import_prefix = "foo",
    visibility = ["//visibility:public"],
)
```

You can tell Gazelle how to find this library when lazy indexing is enabled with the
directive:

```bzl
# gazelle:proto_search foo third_party/foo/proto
```

The first argument is a prefix to remove from an import string. The second is a prefix
to add. So when Gazelle sees the import string `foo/api.proto` in a file, it's transformed
to `third_party/foo/proto/api.proto`. Gazelle then indexes the directory
`third_party/foo/proto` after removing the base name.

You can specify the `proto_search` directive multiple times. It applies in the directory
where it's written and to subdirectories. An empty `proto_search` directory resets the
list of translation rules for the current directory.

**Directive:** `# gazelle:proto_strip_import_prefix path`
**Default:** n/a
Sets the [`strip_import_prefix`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/protocol-buffer.html#proto_library.strip_import_prefix) attribute of generated `proto_library` rules. This is a prefix to strip from the strings used to import `.proto` files.

If the prefix starts with a slash, it's intepreted relative to the repository root. Otherwise, it's relative to the directory containing the build file. The package-relative form is only useful when a single build file covers `.proto` files in subdirectories. Gazelle doesn't generate build files like this, so only paths with a  leading slash should be used. Gazelle will print a warning when the package-relative form is used.

For example, if the target `//proto/a:b_proto` has `srcs = ["b.proto"]` and `strip_import_prefix = "/proto"`, then `b.proto` should be imported with the string `"a/b.proto"`.

**Directive:** `# gazelle:resolve source-lang [import-lang] import-string label`<br>
**Default:** n/a<br>
Specifies an explicit mapping from an import string to a label for [Dependency resolution](#dependency-resolution). Accepts the following arguments:

* `source-lang` is the language of the source code being imported.
* `import-lang` (optional) is the language importing the library. This is usually the same as `source-lang` but may differ with generated code. For example, when resolving dependencies for a `go_proto_library`, `source-lang` would be `"proto"` and `import-lang` would be `"go"`. `import-lang` may be omitted if it is the same as `source-lang`.
* `import-string` is the string used in source code to import a library.
* `label` is the Bazel label that Gazelle should write in `deps`.

For example:

```bzl
# gazelle:resolve go example.com/foo //foo:go_default_library
# gazelle:resolve proto go foo/foo.proto //foo:foo_go_proto
```

**Directive:** `# gazelle:resolve_regexp source-lang import-lang import-string-regexp label`<br>
**Default:** n/a<br>
Specifies an explicit mapping from an import regex to a label for [Dependency resolution](#dependency-resolution). Accepts the following arguments:

* `source-lang` is the language of the source code being imported.
* `import-lang` (optional) is the language importing the library. This is usually the same as `source-lang` but may differ with generated code. For example, when resolving dependencies for a `go_proto_library`, `source-lang` would be `"proto"` and `import-lang` would be `"go"`. `import-lang` may be omitted if it is the same as `source-lang`.
* `import-string-regex` is the regex applied to the import in the source code. If it matches, that import will be resolved to the label specified below.
* `label` is the Bazel label that Gazelle should write in `deps`. The label can be constructed using captured strings from the subpattern matching in `import-string-regex`.

For example:

```bzl
# gazelle:resolve_regexp go example.com/.* //foo:go_default_library
# gazelle:resolve_regexp proto go foo/.*\.proto //foo:foo_go_proto
# gazelle:resolve_regexp proto go foo/(.*)\.proto //foo/$1:foo_rule_proto
```

**Directive:** `# gazelle:go_visibility label`<br>
**Default:** n/a<br>
By default, internal packages are only visible to its siblings. This directive adds a label internal packages should be visible to additionally. This directive can be used several times, adding a list of labels.

**Directive:** `# gazelle:lang lang1,lang2`<br>
**Default:** n/a<br>
Sets the language selection flag for this and descendent packages, which causes gazelle to index and generate rules for only the languages named in this directive.

**Directive:** `# gazelle:default_visibility visibility`<br>
**Default:** n/a<br>
Comma-separated list of visibility specifications. This directive adds the visibility specifications for this and descendant packages. For example:

```bzl
# gazelle:default_visibility //foo:__subpackages__,//src:__subpackages__
```

#### `WORKSPACE` directives

Gazelle also reads directives from the WORKSPACE file. They may be used to discover custom repository names and known prefixes. The `fix` and `update` commands use these directives for dependency resolution. `update-repos` uses them to learn about repository rules defined in alternate locations.

**Directive:** `# gazelle:repository rule_kind attr1_name=attr1_value,...`<br>
**Default:** n/a<br>
Specifies a repository rule that Gazelle should know about. The directive can be repeated multiple times, and can be declared from within a macro definition that Gazelle knows about. At the very least the directive must define a rule kind and a name attribute, but it can define extra attributes after that.

This is useful for teaching Gazelle about repos declared in external macros. The directive can also be used to override an actual repository rule. For example, a `git_repository` rule for `org_golang_x_tools` could be overriden with the directive:

```bzl
# gazelle:repository go_repository name=org_golang_x_tools importpath=golang.org/x/tools
```

Gazelle would then proceed as if `org_golang_x_tools` was declared as a `go_repository` rule.

**Directive:** `# gazelle:repository_macro [+]macroFile%defName`<br>
**Default:** n/a<br>
Tells Gazelle to look for repository rules in a macro in a .bzl file. The directive can be repeated multiple times. The macro can be generated by calling `update-repos` with the `to_macro` flag. The directive can be prepended with a `+`, which will tell Gazelle to also look for repositories within any macros called by the specified macro.

### Keep comments

In addition to directives, Gazelle supports `# keep` comments that protect parts of build files from being modified. `# keep` may be written before a rule, before an attribute, or after a string within a list.

`# keep` comments might take one of 2 forms; the `# keep` literal or a description prefixed by `# keep:`.

#### Example

Suppose you have a library that includes a generated .go file. Gazelle won't know what imports to resolve, so you may need to add dependencies manually with
`# keep` comments.

```bzl
load("@io_bazel_rules_go//go:def.bzl", "go_library")
load("@com_github_example_gen//:gen.bzl", "gen_go_file")

gen_go_file(
    name = "magic",
    srcs = ["magic.go.in"],
    outs = ["magic.go"],
)

go_library(

## Dependency resolution

One of Gazelle's most important jobs is resolving library import strings (like `import "golang.org/x/sys/unix"`) to Bazel labels (like `@org_golang_x_sys//unix:go_default_library`). Gazelle follows the rules below to resolve dependencies:

1. If the import to be resolved is part of a standard library, no explicit dependency is written. For example, in Go, you don't need to declare that you depend on `"fmt"`.
1. If a `# gazelle:resolve` directive matches the import to be resolved, the label at the end of the directive will be used.
1. If proto rule generation is enabled, special rules will be used when importing certain libraries. These rules may be disabled by adding `# gazelle:proto disable_global` to a build file (this will affect subdirectories, too) or by passing `-proto disable_global` on the command line.
    1. Imports of Well Known Types are mapped to rules in `@io_bazel_rules_go//proto/wkt`.
    1. Imports of `github.com/golang/protobuf/ptypes`, `descriptor`, and `jsonpb` are mapped to special rules in `@com_github_golang_protobuf`. See [Avoiding conflicts with proto rules](https://github.com/bazel-contrib/rules_go/blob/master/proto/core.rst#avoiding-conflicts).
1. If the import to be resolved is in the library index, the import will be resolved to that library. If `-index=all`, Gazelle builds an index of library rules in the current repository before starting dependency resolution. This can take a while, since Gazelle visits every directory in the repository. If `-index=lazy`, then language extensions may hint at specific directories to visit, which can be much faster.
    1. For Go, the match is based on the `importpath` attribute.
    1. For proto, the match is based on the `srcs` attribute.
1. If `-index=none` and a package is imported that has the current `go_prefix` as a prefix, Gazelle generates a label following a convention. For example, if the build file in `//src` set the prefix with `# gazelle:prefix example.com/repo/foo`, and you import the library `"example.com/repo/foo/bar`, the dependency will be `"//src/foo/bar:go_default_library"`.
1. Otherwise, Gazelle will use the current `external` mode to resolve the dependency.
    1. In `external` mode (the default), Gazelle will transform the import string into an external repository label. For example, `"golang.org/x/sys/unix"` would be resolved to `"@org_golang_x_sys//unix:go_default_library"`. Gazelle does not confirm whether the external repository is actually declared in WORKSPACE, but if there *is* a `go_repository` in WORKSPACE with a matching `importpath`, Gazelle will use its name. Gazelle does not index rules in external repositories, so it's possible the resolved dependency does not exist.
    1. In `static` mode, Gazelle has the same behavior as `external` mode, except that it will not call out to the network for resolution when no matching import is found within WORKSPACE. Instead, it will skip the unknown import. This is the default mode for `go_repository` rules.
    1. In `vendored` mode, Gazelle will transform the import string into a label in the vendor directory. For example, `"golang.org/x/sys/unix"` would be resolved to `"//vendor/golang.org/x/sys/unix:go_default_library"`. This mode is usually not necessary, since vendored libraries will be indexed and resolved using rule 4.

## Fix command transformations

Gazelle will generate and update build files when invoked with either `gazelle update` or `gazelle fix` (`update` is the default). Both commands perform several transformations to fix deprecated usage of the Go rules. `update` performs a safe set of tranformations, while `fix` performs some additional transformations that may delete or rename rules.

The following transformations are performed:

**Migrate library to embed (fix and update):** Gazelle replaces `library` attributes with `embed` attributes.

**Migrate gRPC compilers (fix and update):** Gazelle converts `go_grpc_library` rules to `go_proto_library` rules with `compilers = ["@io_bazel_rules_go//proto:go_grpc_v2"]`.

**Flatten srcs (fix and update):** Gazelle converts `srcs` attributes that use OS and architecture-specific `select` expressions to flat lists. rules_go filters these sources anyway.

**Squash cgo libraries (fix only)**: Gazelle will remove `cgo_library` rules named `cgo_default_library` and merge their attributes with a `go_library` rule in the same package named `go_default_library`. If no such `go_library` rule exists, a new one will be created. Other `cgo_library` rules will not be removed.

**Squash external tests (fix only)**: Gazelle will squash `go_test` rules named `go_default_xtest` into `go_default_test`. Earlier versions of rules_go required internal and external tests to be built separately, but this is no longer needed.

**Remove legacy protos (fix only)**: Gazelle will remove usage of `go_proto_library` rules loaded from `@io_bazel_rules_go//proto:go_proto_library.bzl` and `filegroup` rules named `go_default_library_protos`. Newly generated proto rules will take their place. Since `filegroup` isn't needed anymore and `go_proto_library` has different attributes and was always written by hand, Gazelle will not attempt to merge anything from these rules with the newly generated rules.

This transformation is only applied in the default proto mode. Since Gazelle will run in legacy proto mode if `go_proto_library.bzl` is loaded, this transformation is not usually applied. You can set the proto mode explicitly using the directive `# gazelle:proto default`.

**Update loads of gazelle rule (fix and update)**: Gazelle will remove loads of `gazelle` from `@io_bazel_rules_go//go:def.bzl`. It will automatically add a load from `@bazel_gazelle//:def.bzl` if `gazelle` is not loaded from another location.
